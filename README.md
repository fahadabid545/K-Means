# K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm from scratch and using scikit-learn. It includes visualizations to better understand how the algorithm groups data into clusters.

## 🚀 Features

- K-Means clustering from scratch and using `sklearn`
- Visual comparison of different cluster counts (k-values)
- Evaluation using Elbow Method
- Cluster visualization on 2D datasets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure

- `kmeans_from_scratch.ipynb`: Implementation of K-Means without using libraries
- `kmeans_sklearn.ipynb`: Using scikit-learn for clustering
- `images/`: Cluster visualization outputs
